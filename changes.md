#### 1.0.1
  - bug with eaten arguments when using `Upgrade.reference` correct.
    Thanks [Austin Matzko](https://github.com/matzko) for finding and reporting it!
  - check for import expose shadowing
  - parenthesize type replacements if needed
  - don't parenthesize a replacement expression if it's just a reference
